**Generative AI is a transformative technology**

The last year has seen a spectacular acceleration in generative AI: systems able to generate text / image conditioned on text and images. Those systems can help humans:

● produce superb creative content (text, code, graphics)

● read, process and summarise unstructured content streams thousands of times faster than humans

● interact with the world (exposed through natural or application interfaces) to execute workflows faster than ever before.

The power of generative AI was suddenly demonstrated to the general audience with the release of ChatGPT; this kind of product has been in the making by only a few small teams across the world — the few researchers of these teams are now the limiting factor to create new economic actors in the field.

Generative AI is about to boost productivity in all sectors and create a new industry (10B market size as of 2022, projected to be 110B by 2030, with an estimated growth rate of 35% per year), by seamlessly enhancing the human mind with machine capabilities. It is a transformative technology for the world economy that will change the nature of work to bring positive societal changes.
